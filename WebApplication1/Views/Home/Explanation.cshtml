    <p class="lead">
        The Monty Hall problem is a probability puzzle based on a scenario from the game show Let's Make a Deal. Imagine you’re a contestant faced with three doors. Behind one door is a prize - a car. While behind the other two doors are goats. Your goal is to pick the door hiding the car.
    </p>

    <p>
        Here’s how the game works: First, you select one of the three doors but don’t open it yet. Then, the host, knowing what’s behind all the doors, opens one of the other two doors, always revealing a goat. Now, you have a choice: stick with your original door or switch to the remaining unopened door.
    </p>

    <p>
        At first, it might seem that your chances are 50/50 since two doors remain. However, switching doors actually doubles your chances of winning.
    </p>

    <p>
        Why? When you first pick a door, there’s a 1 in 3 chance that you’ve chosen the car, and a 2 in 3 chance that you’ve picked a goat. If your initial pick was the car (1/3 chance), switching will make you lose. But if your initial pick was a goat (2/3 chance), switching will win you the car. So by always switching, you capitalize on that larger 2/3 probability.

        Or imagine that the doors are split into 2 groups. The door you initially chose is group A, having 1 in 3 chance of having a car. Group B consists of the 2 remaining doors, having 2 in 3 chance of containing the car. The host will eliminate one door from group B. However the initial chance of the car being in group B stays the same (2/3 chance). By switching you can capitalize on the larger probability of the car being in group B.
    </p>

    <p>
        In summary, sticking with your first choice gives you a 33% chance of winning, while switching increases your odds to 67%. This counterintuitive result highlights the importance of considering conditional probabilities rather than just the remaining options.
